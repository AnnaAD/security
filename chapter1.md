### 1.1 Introduction

- security engineering = building depedable systems
- cross-discipline: cryptography, hardware tamper-resistance

### 1.2 A Framework

- policy to achieve
- mechanism to obtain: i.e. cipers, access controls
- assurance: amount of resilience
- incentive: the motive to gaurd the system

### 1.3 Example 1 - Banks

### 1.4 Example 2 - Military Base

- low-probability-of-intercept radio links because enemy, seeing enciphered text, could still attack trasmitter

### 1.5 Example 3 - A Hospital

### 1.6 Example 4 - The Home

### 1.7 Definitions

- system = product, component, os, communications, applications, users, staff, customers
- clarity about players
- principal = entity that participates
- identity = corresponsdance between names of 2 principals
- trust = failure breaks security vs. trustworthy = system that won't fail
- secrecy = techinal term to limit principals that can access
- confidentiality = obligation to protect secrets
- privacy is the ability to protect personal info and extends to the ability to prevent invasions
- anonymity
- authenticity = talking to the correct person and integrity
- integrity = no tampering
- vulnerability = with a threat leads to secuity failure (breach in security policy)
- security target = means in which a security policy will be implemented
- protection profile device independent way to eval diff. versions

### 1.8 Summary
