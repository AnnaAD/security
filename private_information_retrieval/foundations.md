# Private Information Retrieval

## Project Idea

Implement basic PIR with homomorphic encryption
- use https://github.com/ibarrond/Pyfhel library
- have a basic matrix representing the data
- have a client.py file
- have a server.py file which contains the matrix data
- have the client.py file construct a request with the encrypted bitmask array
- have the server perform the operation and extract the row -> returning the data
